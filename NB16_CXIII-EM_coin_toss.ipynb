    "The goal of this notebook is to gain intuition for Expectation Maximization using a simple example involving coin tosses.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section XIV, we introduce Expectation-Maximization (EM) as a practical way to perform maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) even when some of the data is hidden (i.e in the presence of latent or hidden variables). To better understand EM, in this short notebook we'll explore a very simple coin-tossing example adapted from [Do and Batzoglou, Nat. Biotechnol. (2008)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1406). \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we are given two coins A and B with unkown bias $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$, respectively. Our goal is to estimate the bias vector $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}= (\\theta_A, \\theta_B)$ from the outcomes of the following experiment: \n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote> \n",
    "First choose one coin at random. Then toss the selected coin 10 times independently and record the number of heads observed. Repeat this procedure 5 times.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, let $z_i\\in\\{A,B\\}$ be the coin selected in experiment $i$ and $x_i\\in\\{0,1,\\cdots 10\\}$ be the number heads recorded by tossing $z_i$ 10 times. Since we conduct $n=5$ such experiments, we can summarize the outcomes of these 50 tosses by two vectors: $\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,x_2\\cdots, x_5)$ and $\\boldsymbol{z}=(z_1,z_2,\\cdots, z_5)$.\n",

    "\n",
    " * Consider first the case where we have complete knowledge of the experiment, namely, both $\\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\\boldsymbol{z}$ are known. How would you intuitively estimate the biases of the two coins  $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}= (\\theta_A, \\theta_B)$ ? \n",

    "Answer: Assuming $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ represent the probabilities for each coin to yield head. Take the average number of heads for each coins across all experiments.\n",

    " * What's the likelihood of observing the complete outcomes of these experiments? In other words, what is $P(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{z}| n,\\boldsymbol{\\theta} )$? You may assume this is a Bernoulli trial. Namely, every time coin A(B) is tossed, we have, with probability $\\theta_A$($\\theta_B$), that the outcome is heads.\n",

The following code computes our best guess for the biases using MLE -- assuming we know the identity of the coin used -- and compares it estimates arrived at using an EM procedure where we have no knowledge about which coin was being tossed (though we know the same coin was tossed 10 times)."

    " * Following Exercise 1, what's the objective function we're optimizing in the E-step? Does this function have a *unique global maximum*? \n",

    "Answer: The true values are $\\theta_A = 0.8$ and $\\theta_B = 0.4$. For the values given by the initial run of the code are theta_A = 0.765867,  theta_B = 0.396945 for EM and theta_A = 0.766667,  theta_B = 0.350000 MLE with complete data. Compared to the true values, EM seems to be more accurate for this run. However, for different runs one might perform better than the other which is due to the to the large variance of sample expectation for such a low number of trials. Incresing the number of coin tosses to 10000 for example already drstically improves the results of both method to the point were both perform indistinguishably efficiently.\n"

    "From Exercise 2 and Section XIV, we know that the E-M algorithm often approximates the MLE even in the presence of latent (hidden variables). Like with most optimization methods for nonconcave functions, E-M only guarantees convergence to a local maximum of the objective function. For this reason, its performance can be boosted by running the EM procedure starting with multiple initial parameters. "
